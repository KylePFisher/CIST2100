    People in need for a fast laptop with certain professional softwares
        They need laptops that are faster than library's to save time
        Ease of time for in state shipping or pickup at warehouse through order on website
        They just need it for a certain amount of days because there maybe problems with their own computers

## Value proposition ideas:
The value from our business will come from the quick and easy online retail application we will build for renting laptops.
Value will also come from the fact that students will be able to work wherever and whenever, without ever having to go to a library to use their systems. 
Our app will first be available for mobile devices due to the fact that students who need laptops will likely only have a phone to use. 
The application will show the types of laptops available, their specifications, and pricing rates for each day the student would like to rent them.
After the student chooses from the list of laptops they will be able to pay in the app for the number of days desired and choose to either have it shipped to their address or pick it up at our office location. 
This simple application will solve the pain points that students without laptops often face when they cannot fit going to the library in their schedule.
Our business will provide students with the freedom of working on whatever they want to, wherever they want to, whenever they want to.

## Business overview:
The customer segments we're targeting consist of lower-middle class students who would benefit from a laptop required for their coursework, but cannot afford one of thier own.
The customer segments mentioned is a relatively swollen market with the onset of online classes; however, we're focusing on a primary customer segment that would consist of lower-middle class students going into a trade specifically requirng coursework on computers, such as Information Technology or Engineering students.
Our laptop rental business is highly specialized for providing a small selection of quality laptops to the end consumers efficiently and cost effectively, with a variety of software that can be selected upon rental.
The product line offerings are a customizable mixture of laptops and software (though there would be warnings/errors for incompatible or hardware intensive software). 
The hardware offerings would start with very economical laptops such as Chromebooks and budget laptops, with some mid-range laptops and a small amount of more powerful high-end machines on offer.
Having a decent variety of machines allows us to target our primary customer segment more effectively since we allow them a cost-effective way to use their preferred software, anywhere they find time to study between work and other responsibilities.
As the project line ages over the next five years, we can offer our older laptops for lower prices, such as refurbished or aging high-end machines which gives us more longevity out of our laptops and keep costs down for our primary customer segment.
The software on offer would consist of common producitivty software such as the Microsoft Office suite, but also includes options for specialized software such as IntelliJ and AutoCAD for Information Technology and Engineering students respectively.
As the business grows over time, the current software offerings would become cheaper thanks to economy of scale with licensing costs. More software would also be offered, to allow for more specialized students to leverage the service such as Health Information Technology or Automotive Technology students.
