## Our Key Partners

* Shipping Services (USPS)
  * Services from these companies will be vital for our business model. Through these services we can promise a timely arrival of our laptops
  for students who ordered them to their address. They also provide a key service for shipping any hardware we made need to fix our laptops
  when they eventually get broken. They help us reduce costs by allowing us to rely on their logistics systems instead of building our own.
  Overall, shipping services will help our company get products to and from our location while reducing the headache that shipping causes.
* Laptop Distributors (Hewlett Packard, Laptop Plaza, Ambar Distributors)
  * These distributors are also vital to our company as we will need an initial supply of many laptops to rent out. The distributors listed
  sell electronics wholesale so we will be able to get a lower price for any laptops/hardware needed. This helps our key activities as a
  business by providing what we need to either fix or upgrade a set of laptops hardware or replace laptops entirely. As we grow as a business
  we will continue to use these distribution companies to provide reliable laptops for students to use.
* Insurance Companies (Asurion, Worth Ave.)
  * With letting people use our laptops we will need to insure our products for the damages they will eventually have. Companies like
  Asurion will help overall with lowering the costs of fixing our devices. The key activities that these companies interact with mainly has
  to do with the management of our laptop inventory as a whole as we will likely have constant issues to deal with.
* Community Colleges / Universities around Omaha (MCC, UNO)
  * Our final group of partners are universities. If we can get a university/college to work with our business, it would help us massively 
  to reach the students of that university/college. This would be influential in our key processes by helping students know about our
  service. Partnering with these institutions would lower our costs heavily as we will not have to do as much on the groundwork to let
  students know about Laptops for Students.
* Software Companies (SolidWorks, Autodesk, CorelDRAW, etc.)
  * These companies that provide these software are crucial to our business model because we need to make affordable deals with them so
  that 
    we can rent the program for a long time with more competitive price and make difference from renting the laptops out for students
