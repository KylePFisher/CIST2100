## Key Activities

Our key activities are shipping laptops for students to use. We'll be developing physical and digital products. In terms of physical
products, we'll be providing our store front for students to help them make any choices on renting laptops. This provides great value in
that it allows students who do not have any access to technology to be able to rent a laptop via a physical location.

In terms of digital products our app will be looking to provide something to the similar effect of a store, but on a user's phone. The
value of this is obvious in that it allows users to use the app as if they were there in person.

We also have a website as a digital platform for information and orders. This'll provide customers the opportunity to check the
information of their orders and make sure everything is correct. 

Any issues will be solved through digital and physical means whether they have a question to ask on the app/website or in the store
we'll be able to help. This'll help the value of our business in that the customers will always have some form of assistance available 
to them during the day.

Also, if they have any problem with laptops during rental period, we can immediately provide fixes or laptop substitution since the 
business is local in Nebraska. Like the previous activity this helps our business satisfy the customers needs of our service. 

## Key Resources

* Secure room to store laptops - rent
  * Laptops would most likely be stored in the backroom of our office behind locked doors. Our office location will also be monitored by
  a security alarm system like ADT or Brink's. We will not have a person working security in person, but police will be notified when
  any kind of breach occurs.
* Rented servers - rent
  * Servers will either be rented from Amazon Web Services (AWS) or a company like IBM. The servers will host our website and handle any
  needed space for data storage. Servers will provide value to our company by allowing us space to store information about our inventory
  and data about our customers. Value is also provided through allowing our users to quickly use our application and website without
  slow response times.
* Application developers - Our own
  * In order to build an application, we will need developers. We will be looking to hire a team of developers to put together our mobile app for
  Android and iOS devices. This provides value to the business as we need a well-designed application to get our business rolling. 
* Store front (at office) - rent
  * We would most likely rent out space near major roads in the Omaha area. More specifically, a location around either I-80 or Dodge Rd would be most ideal. This would provide great value to our business as it would provide a central place for customers to ask questions as well as providing a central place for employees to work. 
* Laptops - purchase
  * Laptops are obviously needed for our company to operate so we will be needing a large quantity of them. We'll be looking to find the
  cheapest pricing on laptops of a couple tiers to start out. The first tier will be a laptop with good enough specifications to
  comfortably run programs like Word, Excel, Google Chrome, etc. so that students can get their vital work done. A second tier will be
  provided for students who need a more powerful computer for their classes. This second tier will be a computer with a higher end CPU,
  more RAM and possibly a decent GPU.
* Our brand name "Laptops for Students" - Our own
  * We will trademark our brand name to protect its use. Our brand name will be included in our application and website.
  Hopefully our name--as straightforward as it is--will get the message out about what we do.
* IT services and clerks for store front - rent and hire
  * For our services to help those with issues we will try and have a good staff of technicians to help solve issues students may have.
  This will provide a great amount of value to our company as it will hopefully bring a good reputation to our business by providing
  excellent and timely service.
* Online clerks for questions and order information - hire
* Shipping companies: FedEx, UPS, USPS - Business partners
* Set of business and industrial programs for purchases - purchase

## Key Technologies
Our business focuses on three key areas in relation to requiring key technologies:
* The online storefront
* The mobile application
* The logistics management
* Business management software

The website/digital storefront requires servers hosting a web service stack such as a LAMP stack. These servers will need an OS, web server software, and a database.

The mobile application will require back-end APIs to display dynamic content and products, as well as process payments, so a web application stack is required here. Our mobile developers will also need access to a decent IDE and test environments to develop new updates to the mobile app.

Our logistics service will largely be managed using a transaction processing system such as an inventory management system. This system should allow efficient tracking and maintenance of inventory, deliveries, and allow access for support to assist with customer problems.

Business management software handles the profiles of employees for salaries, punctuality, online personal documents for legal contacts.
