## Our Revenue Streams

The one and only source of revenue for our business will be from the renting of our laptops. After crunching some numbers we hope to reach
1-6% of the student population of MCC and UNO. Given that 17% of students struggle to finish their homework due to todays 'digital divide'
(Anderson & Perrin, 2018),
we hope to reach at most a third of those students struggling. In the 2016-17 academic year MCC and UNO had 6,396 and 12,333 students
respectively. If we were to reach 3% of those students we would bring in 562 students to our services. Assuming the students use the
computers approximately 100 days a year and at a $5 per day flat rate (tenative number) our total revenue would be $281,000 a year.
